an online cook book called "mobile cook" that matches recipes with the ingredients needed.
# Plan
The app is an online cook book that allows you to search an ingredient and recipes that match with them.

1. the first table will just be ingredients with an ID and the name.
2. the second will be a recipe with an ID, name, and the person who created it.
3. the third table will be used to match the ID of the recipe with the ID of the ingredients used.
4. I will also have a users table with a name, email, and password for the users of the app


# Database
I then need to go onto google cloud and create a new SQL database then link it to mysql workbench by linking the host name, password, and the adress.
